========================

April 16, 2014 Finally Success!




I have got sound working using Phonegap Build 3.4 html5 audio play tags activated using javascript.

Also using the Device plugin I have got working polyphonic playing of multiple .mp3, .wav or .m4a

Quick playing of the files using .play then .pause as a pre-load (This should be put in an onDeviceReady function)
Record of audio to the Download folder or the root of the sdcard. Very finicky about naming when recording. Flexible on playback. 

Just found out that if you make a folder on you sdcard, then that folder can be saved into using the start record button.



The index.html code can be used on win8 Chrome. It does not work on many other platforms. However if you want to do any advanced sound work I would suggest using the Media plugin.
